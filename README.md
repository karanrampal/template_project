# A template for future projects

Creating a template, for future projects, which can be hosted on Github. After cloning and manipulating the git directory (deleting :wink:) it can be used as starting point for any other project.

Contains starter code for model creation, training, testing and evaluation using Pytorch. Hence no need to create these from scratch everytime, just modify the relevant files for the particular project.

## Reference
Borrowed heavily and modified slightly from the lovely [Stanford's CS230 course](https://github.com/cs230-stanford "Stanford's deep learning course") course.
*I don't know how to cite them, hopefully this is enough as reference for me to not get in any kind of trouble.*
